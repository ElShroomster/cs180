		<h3>Part 1:<b> Selfie: The Wrong Way vs. The Right Way</b></h3>

		<p>For this part, we had to take a selfie of ourselves from different perspectives, namely close up versus far away. In all the pictures, we wanted our face to be the same size despite how close we were to the camera. The pictures should get better and better as we step further away and zoom in.</p>

		<div class="row">
		  <div class="column">
			  <img src="./images/selfie_0.png" alt="0">
		  </div>
		  <div class="column">
			  <img src="./images/selfie_1.png" alt="1">
		  </div>
		  <div class="column">
			<img src="./images/selfie_2.png" alt="2">
		  </div>
		  <div class="column">
			<img src="./images/selfie_3.png" alt="3">
		  </div>
		  <div class="column">
			<img src="./images/selfie_4.png" alt="4">
		  </div>
		  <div class="column">
			<img src="./images/selfie_5.png" alt="5">
		  </div>
	  	</div>

		<p>This was quite a decent result, however I noticed that the more we had to zoom, my iPhone decided to pick a camera with differing levels of saturation, leading to my face looking more and more orange. Also, we can see that the second photo looks quite a bit better than the first.</p>

		<p>Thinking about why this is, I learned in cs 184 that if we want to keep our subject the same size while also having to step back, we have to adjust the f-stop of our camera, which directly leads to us changing the focal length. The closer we are to the image, the larger the FOV we need, meaning that our focal length is much less. This causes a distortion commonly seen in fisheye cameras where the perspective gets messed up.</p>

		<h3>Part 2:<b> Architectural Perspective Composition</b></h3>

		<p>The reverse effect of apperance happens for taking pictures of landscape, or for our purpose, a building. We took pictures of a building as we walked closer to it.</p>

		<div class="row">
		  <div class="column5">
			  <img src="./images/building_1_1.png" alt="0">
		  </div>
		  <div class="column5">
			  <img src="./images/building_1_2.png" alt="1">
		  </div>
		  <div class="column5">
			  <img src="./images/building_1_3.png" alt="2">
		  </div>
		  <div class="column5">
			  <img src="./images/building_1_4.png" alt="3">
		  </div>
		  <div class="column5">
			  <img src="./images/building_1_5.png" alt="4">
		  </div>
	  	</div>

		<p>This was a pretty good example which shows that a building gets more perspective as we get closer, and it becomes flattened and compressed as we moved further away. I wanted a couple more photos to make sure this was actually the case.</p>

		<div class="row">
			<div class="column7">
				<img src="./images/building_2_1.png" alt="0">
			</div>
			<div class="column7">
				<img src="./images/building_2_2.png" alt="1">
			</div>
			<div class="column7">
				<img src="./images/building_2_3.png" alt="2">
			</div>
			<div class="column7">
				<img src="./images/building_2_4.png" alt="3">
			</div>
			<div class="column7">
				<img src="./images/building_2_5.png" alt="4">
			</div>
			<div class="column7">
				<img src="./images/building_2_6.png" alt="5">
			</div>
			<div class="column7">
				<img src="./images/building_2_7.png" alt="6">
			</div>
		</div>

		<p>Yep, this is definitely true.</p>

		<h3>Part 3:<b> The Dolly Zoom</b></h3>
		
		<p>In this section, we'll be implementing the Dolly Zoom effect, aka the vertigo shot. Thank you Kyle for letting me take pictures of you :)</p>

		<div class="row">
			<div class="column5">

		<p>Unfortunately this is a little hard to see with just images... so I created a GIF!</p>

            <img src="./images/kyle.gif" alt="Dolly Zoom GIF">
        </center>

		<p>The results were great! Despite this, I wanted to make a video that seemed more realistic and like the movies, so I practiced my steady walking and zooming skills, and I took this video:</p>

		<div class="video-container">
		<video autoplay loop playsinline>
			<source src="kyle.mp4" type="video/mp4">
			<source src="kyle.webm" type="video/webm">
			Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos.
		</video>
		</div>
		
		<p>And with this, I was satisfied with the final results of the project.</p>
